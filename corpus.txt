Test my balls in the freezer you evil prick! I'm not going to let you generate sentences from this sample text! I'd much rather do it all myself, but if you must give it a go, then please go ahead! Oh no! It has cancer! The bird fly in the air and the sky is blue. The company generated record profits last year. The profits totaled at 150 million dollars, while expenditure was down 15%. I love taking a lonely drive along the coast. Listening to the sea at night gives me the chills, while at the same time, it calms me greatly. I don't want to get married. A long-term relationship is a surefire way to die inside. Driving an internal-combustion engine-powered vehicle is a highly irresponsible thing to do in 2016. This year, I would like to get a high-paying job and travel to a warm country and do nothing but suntan. The ultimate goal of this project was to pinpoint the ingredients to Procter & Gamble's (P&G)continued success in a vast number of industries. To gain insight into the company's operations, I conducted analyses aimed at understanding the company's business model. This was done through deliberate analysis of Ariel, one of P&G's leading brands, through analyzing the products segmentation and marketing.     To further gain insight into the business's success, when compared toits competitors I conducted a Porter's analysis with the goal of benchmarking the business to Unilever, a close competitor to P&G. The brand, which Unilever promotes to compete with Ariel isPersil, and through the analysis of these two companies' sales strategies and their respective brands, we can determine what create success for these businesses.         The results of these analyses led meto conclude that P&G's success results from the high value the company places on deliberately nurturing innovation within its organization. Itstarted this trend over a century ago through its investment in one of the first company-funded research institutes. The company also robustly diversified its brand portfolio in the past and stayed atop of its business through the strategic phase-out of declining brands and their replacement with newly created ones. This serves tokeepup consumer interest in the firm's brands as well asto continuously improve its offering.  After in-depth analysis of P&G's inner workings, the organizations of sales comes down to a few important factors. The company relies on the quality and speed of the response of its distribution network.  The main areas where improvements are needed are the fields of communications in this case. The company recently invested in a set of " Business Spheres". These are rooms where the company has access to data and analytics from global sources, allowing for rapid decision-making and action in case of unexpected events. The company aims to boost the effectiveness of its distribution and marketing response this way.  They are looking for a " 'fully interconnected platform' that delivers 'holistic optimization.'  If they can get to a 'real-time instrumented supply chain,' P&G believes the upside is a 1-2% sales increase, 2-5% margin improvement, and 5-10% improvements in asset utilization. The "Business Sphere" is one of the first puzzle pieces in this approach. (Banker, 2015)P&G main reasoning behind this is the need to increase margins. They company has made several divestments in the past, while at the same time investing inR&D. After analyzing the situation using a DuPont analysis and looking at the firm's annual report, we can see that this has resulted in a sudden drop in the company's profit margins and subsequently its ROE. Since 2014, the company's profit margins fell by a third, with its ROE resting at a 
decade low. Fortunately, this seems tobe a result of the company's continued aim toimprove its product offering through robust innovation. (Stock Analysis on Net, 2015)P&G is looking to introduce new products into its existing brand portfolio in the near future. This isan aim to ride the increasing customers spending in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. The business is currently in a difficult point in its history, even though things appear tobe positive.  The company has to put increased effort into tapping into online technologies and tocompete with online giants tobe successful in the 21st century. Without more focus on catering to online retailers in favor of offline points of sale, the company could find itself outnumbered in the digital world.
